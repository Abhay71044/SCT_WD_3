# SCT_WD_3
A fun and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players can compete against each other or the computer. The game handles user clicks, tracks game state, and checks winning conditions for an engaging experience.
# ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe Web Application

## 📌 Project Overview
This is an interactive Tic Tac Toe web application that allows users to play either against another player (Player vs Player) or against the computer (Player vs AI). The game handles user clicks, tracks the game state, checks winning conditions, and provides a smooth, engaging gameplay experience.

## ✨ Features
- Two game modes: Player vs Player and Player vs AI
- Interactive 3×3 game board
- Real-time game state tracking
- Automatic win and draw detection
- Simple AI with strategic move selection
- Turn counter and status updates
- Responsive and modern UI design
- Smooth animations and hover effects

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Structure and layout
- **CSS3** – Styling, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Game logic, AI behavior, and DOM manipulation

## 🎮 Game Modes
### Player vs Player (PvP)
Two players take turns playing on the same device.

### Player vs AI
Play against the computer with an AI that:
1. Tries to win if possible  
2. Blocks the player from winning  
3. Takes the center position  
4. Chooses corners strategically  
5. Selects any available cell  

## ⚙️ How the Game Works
- The game board is represented using an array of 9 elements.
- Each click updates the board state and UI.
- After every move, the game checks for a winner or draw.
- The AI uses rule-based logic to determine the best possible move.
- Game status and turn count update dynamically.
